```

## Notes

- To use this plugins with Active Admin 1.x please use the version [0.1.3](https://github.com/blocknotes/activeadmin_froala_editor/releases/tag/v0.1.3)
- **data-options**: permits to set *froala editor* options directly from the form field (examples below) - see [options list](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor/docs/options)

## Examples

### Basic usage

```ruby
# Active Admin article form conf:
  form do |f|
    f.inputs 'Article' do
      f.input :title
      f.input :description, as: :froala_editor
      f.input :published
    end
    f.actions
  end
```

### Toolbar buttons configuration

```ruby
# Form field
f.input :description, as: :froala_editor, input_html: { data: { options: { toolbarButtons: ['undo', 'redo', '|', 'bold', 'italic'] } } }
```

### Froala upload plugin

```ruby
# Upload method (to be included in the admin entity configuration)
member_action :upload, method: [:post] do
  success = resource.images.attach(params[:file_upload])
  result = success ? { link: url_for(resource.images.last) } : {}
  render json: result
end
```

```ruby
# Form field
f.input :description, as: :froala_editor, input_html: { data: { options: { imageUploadParam: 'file_upload', imageUploadURL: upload_admin_post_path(resource.id), toolbarButtons: %w[bold italic underline | insertImage insertVideo insertFile] } } }
```

For the relevant files of an upload example see [here](examples/upload_plugin_using_activestorage/).
Consider that this is just a basic example: images are uploaded as soon as they are attached to the
 editor (regardless of the form submit), it shows the editor only for an existing record (because of
the *upload_admin_post_path*) and it doesn't provide a way to remove images (just deleting them from
the editor will not destroy them, you'll need to implement a purge logic for that).
